# Starter Bots for TicTacToe in the AI Leagues

This is the repository for the Tic Tac Toe starter bots for the AI
Leagues competition.

You can copy the bot in the language you prefer and modify it as you
like. It will give you a starting point with the AI League protocol
already implemented.

# AI Leagues

AI Leagues is the upcoming site where YOU can create your own bot,
upload it, and have it compete against other users' bots.  AI Leagues
features:

 * Game ladders for several different games
 * Support for multiple programming languages
 * A website with full control over your bots.

More games and more programming languages will come soon!
